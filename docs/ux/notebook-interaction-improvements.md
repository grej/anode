# Notebook UX Improvements Specification

## Overview

This document outlines specific UX improvements to make Anode's notebook interface more fluid and Jupyter-like, while preserving the real-time collaborative advantages of LiveStore.

## Current Problems

### 1. Cell Interaction Model Issues
- **Click-to-edit pattern** breaks notebook flow
- **No keyboard navigation** between cells
- **Heavy card UI** feels cluttered compared to clean notebook interfaces
- **Hover-only controls** are hard to discover and use

### 2. Execution Flow Problems
- **Separate run button** requires extra clicks
- **No standard keyboard shortcuts** (Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter)
- **Minimal execution feedback** with inconsistent status display
- **No execution count display** in familiar format

### 3. Visual Hierarchy Issues
- **Heavy card styling** creates visual noise
- **No clear focus states** for active cell
- **Inconsistent spacing** between cells
- **Controls appear/disappear** making interface feel unstable

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: Fluid Navigation âœ… COMPLETED

**Status**: Successfully implemented and merged in June 2025.

#### 1.1 Keyboard Navigation Between Cells âœ…
**Goal**: Arrow keys move between cells naturally

**âœ… Completed Implementation**:
- **Down arrow** at bottom of textarea moves to next cell
- **Up arrow** at top of textarea moves to previous cell
- Smart cursor position detection (handles empty cells and edge cases)
- Smooth focus transitions with visual feedback
- Focus state synchronized between mouse and keyboard interactions

**Technical Implementation**:
- Cursor position detection using `selectionStart/selectionEnd`
- Navigation only triggers when at first/last line or empty cell
- React state management for `focusedCellId` across all cell types
- Consistent behavior across Code, SQL, and AI cell types

#### 1.2 Standard Execution Shortcuts âœ…
**Goal**: Match Jupyter keyboard behavior

**âœ… Completed Implementation**:
- **Shift+Enter**: Run cell and move to next (create new cell if at end)
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter**: Run cell and stay in current cell
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate between cells when at top/bottom of content
- **Click focus**: Clicking into any cell updates focus state properly

**Final Implementation**:
```tsx
// Completed: Full keyboard navigation
const handleKeyDown = useCallback((e: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  // Arrow key navigation between cells
  if (e.key === 'ArrowUp' && selectionStart === selectionEnd) {
    const isAtTop = selectionStart === 0 || !beforeCursor.includes('\n')
    if (isAtTop && onFocusPrevious) {
      e.preventDefault()
      updateSource()
      onFocusPrevious()
    }
  }
  // Standard execution shortcuts
  if (e.key === 'Enter' && e.shiftKey) {
    // Shift+Enter: Run cell and move to next âœ…
  } else if (e.key === 'Enter' && (e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey)) {
    // Ctrl/Cmd+Enter: Run cell but stay âœ…
  }
}, [])
```

#### 1.3 Simple Execution Count Display ðŸ“‹ DEFERRED
**Goal**: Show execution order without confusing `In[1]:` format

**Status**: Deferred to Phase 3 - Current execution status badges provide sufficient feedback.

**Current Implementation**:
- Execution status badges show "Running...", "Queued", "âœ“", "Error"
- Sufficient visual feedback without cluttering the interface
- Can be enhanced later with execution counts if needed

### Phase 2: Streamlined Interface âœ… COMPLETED

**Status**: Successfully implemented with Phase 1 in June 2025.

#### 2.1 Reduce Card Weight âœ…
**Goal**: Lighter, cleaner notebook appearance

**âœ… Completed Changes**:
- Removed heavy Card components entirely
- Implemented subtle left border for cell boundaries (focus-based, not hover)
- Minimized padding and margins for cleaner spacing
- Content-first design with minimal container styling

**Final Implementation**:
```tsx
// Completed: Minimal, focus-driven container
<div className={`mb-2 relative group border-l-4 transition-colors pl-4 ${
  autoFocus ? 'border-primary/40' : 'border-transparent'
}`}>
  {/* Clean cell content with focus-based styling */}
  <div className={`rounded-md border transition-colors ${
    autoFocus
      ? 'bg-card border-ring/50'
      : 'bg-card/50 border-border/50 focus-within:border-ring/50'
  }`}>
```

#### 2.2 Better Focus States âœ…
**Goal**: Clear visual feedback for active cell

**âœ… Completed Design**:
- **Focused cell**: Colored left border (blue for code, blue for SQL, purple for AI)
- **Background highlighting**: Subtle card background changes on focus
- **Idle cell**: Transparent border, minimal styling
- **Smooth transitions**: CSS transitions between all states
- **Synchronized focus**: Mouse clicks and keyboard navigation both update focus state

#### 2.3 Context-Sensitive Controls âœ…
**Goal**: Show controls when needed, hide when not

**âœ… Completed Implementation**:
- **Always visible**: Cell type badge, execution status, prominent keyboard shortcuts bar
- **On hover**: Move up/down, add/delete controls (smaller, cleaner buttons)
- **Always accessible**: Run button for code cells, dropdown menus for cell types
- **No hidden functionality**: All essential controls remain discoverable

### Phase 3: Execution Improvements (MEDIUM Priority)

#### 3.1 Better Execution Feedback
**Goal**: Clear status during execution

**Features**:
- **Queued**: Subtle "Queued..." indicator
- **Running**: Progress spinner with "Running..." text
- **Completed**: Execution count appears
- **Error**: Red indicator with "Error" text

#### 3.2 Improved Run Controls
**Goal**: More accessible execution

**Changes**:
- **Run button**: Always visible for code cells, better styling
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Prominently displayed in tooltips
- **Status integration**: Button shows current execution state

### Phase 4: Polish & Refinements (LOW Priority)

#### 4.1 Cell Type Switching
**Goal**: Easier cell type changes

**Improvements**:
- Larger click target for cell type badge
- Better visual hierarchy in dropdown
- Keyboard shortcuts for common types (future)

#### 4.2 Mobile Responsiveness
**Goal**: Works well on touch devices

**Features**:
- Larger touch targets
- Swipe gestures for navigation (future)
- Mobile-friendly control placement
