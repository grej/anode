# Anode Kernel System - Working State

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

The Anode kernel system is now working end-to-end. Kernels can execute Python code from notebook cells successfully.

## Architecture Overview

- **Each notebook = one LiveStore store** (`NOTEBOOK_ID = STORE_ID`)
- **Kernel process**: Python execution server using Pyodide, manually started per notebook
- **Execution queue**: Event-driven system with states: `pending` → `assigned` → `executing` → `completed`
- **Communication**: Events synced via CloudFlare Workers backend

## ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Event Sequence Number Conflicts - FIXED
**Problem**: Kernel was committing events with incorrect sequence numbers.
**Solution**: Added 2-second initial sync delay before kernel commits first event.

### 2. Timestamp Schema Complexity - ELIMINATED
**Problem**: Complex Date ↔ number conversions causing LiveStore shutdowns.
**Solution**: Removed all timestamp fields from schemas and events.

### 3. SQL Column Mismatches - FIXED
**Problem**: Kernel queries referenced non-existent columns (`requestedAt`, `lastHeartbeat`).
**Solution**: Fixed all kernel SQL queries to match actual schema columns.

## Current Working Flow

1. **Start sync backend**: `pnpm dev:sync-only`
2. **Start web client**: `pnpm dev:web-only` 
3. **Start kernel**: `NOTEBOOK_ID=your-notebook-id pnpm dev:kernel`
4. **Create cells** in web interface
5. **Execute cells** - kernel picks up work and runs Python code
6. **See results** displayed in notebook

## What's Working

- ✅ Kernel startup and registration
- ✅ Event sequencing without conflicts
- ✅ Work queue management
- ✅ Python code execution via Pyodide
- ✅ Output generation and storage
- ✅ Multiple notebooks with isolated kernels
- ✅ Stable polling without database errors

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Timestamp Elimination**: Removed all timestamp fields to eliminate conversion complexity and database errors. Simple schemas are more reliable.

**Polling Over Reactivity**: Kernels poll for work instead of using reactive subscriptions. More predictable for complex workflows.

**One Store Per Notebook**: Each notebook gets its own LiveStore database for clean data isolation.

## File Status

### Schema Package (`packages/schema/`)
- ✅ Clean schemas without timestamp fields
- ✅ Working materializers
- ⚠️ Tests need cleanup (still reference removed fields)

### Kernel Client (`packages/dev-server-kernel-ls-client/`)
- ✅ Fixed SQL queries match schema
- ✅ Stable polling loops
- ✅ Python execution working
- ✅ Error handling and debugging

### Web Client (`packages/web-client/`)
- ✅ Updated for simplified schema
- ✅ Cell creation and execution requests working

## Development Commands

```bash
# Core development
pnpm dev                             # Start web + sync
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-123 pnpm dev:kernel  # Start kernel

# Utilities
pnpm reset-storage                   # Clear all local storage
pnpm build:schema                    # Build schema after changes

# Debugging
DEBUG=* NOTEBOOK_ID=test pnpm dev:kernel  # Verbose kernel logs
```

## Next Steps

1. **Clean up tests** - remove timestamp field references
2. **Add error recovery** - handle kernel restart scenarios
3. **Improve kernel lifecycle** - automatic start/stop
4. **Add authentication** - replace insecure tokens

## Key Insights

- Simple schemas beat complex ones for prototypes
- Polling is more reliable than reactive subscriptions for distributed systems
- Initial sync timing matters for event sequencing
- Database query/schema alignment is critical
- Comprehensive logging helps debug distributed systems

The system now provides a solid foundation for collaborative notebook execution.
