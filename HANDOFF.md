## Architecture Overview

**Simplified Design**: One notebook = One LiveStore store (`NOTEBOOK_ID = STORE_ID`)

**Unified Execution Flow**:
1. User executes cell (code or AI) → `executionRequested` event
2. Kernel **instantly detects** work via reactive `queryDb` subscription  
3. Kernel processes (Python execution OR AI mock response) → `executionAssigned` → `executionStarted` → `executionCompleted`
4. Results appear in UI immediately through standard output system

**Key Breakthrough**: Eliminated polling delays entirely - all cell types execute the moment they are run through unified architecture.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development Environment
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev  # Starts web client + sync backend
```

### 2. Create Notebook
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. URL gets notebook ID: `?notebook=notebook-123-abc`
3. Create cells and edit content

### 3. Enable Execution
```bash
# Use actual notebook ID from URL
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-123-abc pnpm dev:kernel
```
**Pro tip**: Click the **Kernel** button in the UI to copy the exact command!

### 4. Execute & Collaborate
- Write Python code in cells
- Press **Ctrl+Enter** to execute
- See results appear instantly
- Share URL with others for real-time collaboration

## Next Phase: AI Integration & Advanced Features

With **fluid navigation complete**, the roadmap focuses on **AI ↔ Python ↔ User interactions** as the key differentiator:

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. **Real AI API Integration** - Replace mock responses with OpenAI, Anthropic, local model calls
2. **Markdown Rendering** - Render AI responses as formatted markdown instead of plain text
3. **Automatic Kernel Lifecycle** - One-click notebook startup with auto-kernel management
4. **Authentication System** - Google OAuth with proper session management
5. **Code Completions** - LSP + kernel-based suggestions with Pyodide integration

### Medium-term Goals
1. **SQL Cell Functionality** - Real database connections and query execution
2. **Enhanced Output Rendering** - Rich media, plots, and interactive visualizations
3. **Collaborative Cursors** - Real-time presence indicators for multiple users
4. **Advanced Cell Operations** - Multi-select, drag-and-drop reordering

### Core Vision
Anode aims to be the **first AI-native collaborative notebook** that truly understands context and enables seamless human-AI-code interaction with enterprise-grade collaboration features. The unified execution architecture makes AI cells first-class citizens alongside code cells.

## Technical Foundation

### Strengths to Preserve
- **Reactive Architecture**: Zero-latency execution via LiveStore `queryDb`
- **Event Sourcing**: Clean audit trail and perfect state management
- **Local-First**: Offline capability with sync when connected
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Effect
- **Simple Schemas**: Removed timestamp complexity for reliability

### Architecture Decisions
- **Event-driven**: All changes are events, enabling perfect collaboration
- **Session-based kernels**: Each kernel gets unique session for isolation
- **Simplified schemas**: No manual timestamp management
- **Reactive over polling**: LiveStore subscriptions eliminate delays

## Development Commands

```bash
# Core workflow
pnpm dev                                 # Web + sync
NOTEBOOK_ID=your-id pnpm dev:kernel      # Kernel for specific notebook

# Utilities  
pnpm reset-storage                       # Clear all data

# Testing
pnpm test                                # Run test suite
pnpm test:watch                          # Watch mode for development

# Individual services
pnpm dev:web-only                        # Web client only
pnpm dev:sync-only                       # Sync backend only
```

```

## Key Implementation Details

### Reactive Breakthrough
**Problem**: Previous polling architecture (500ms-2s delays) was inefficient and slow.

**Solution**: Implemented LiveStore reactive subscriptions with proper event deferral:
```typescript
// Kernel reacts instantly to queue changes
const subscription = store.subscribe(assignedWorkQuery$, {
  onUpdate: async (entries) => {
    // Process work immediately with deferral to avoid race conditions
    setTimeout(async () => { /* process work */ }, 0);
  }
});
```

**Result**: Zero-latency execution - cells run instantly when triggered.

### Event Deferral Pattern
**Problem**: LiveStore reactive queries break if commits happen during execution segments.

**Solution**: Use `setTimeout(..., 0)` to defer event commits outside execution context:
```typescript
// Defer commits to avoid LiveStore execution segment conflicts
setTimeout(() => {
  store.commit(events.executionCompleted({ cellId, result }));
}, 0);
```

**Result**: Stable reactive subscriptions without execution conflicts.

### Schema Simplification
**Problem**: Complex timestamp handling caused LiveStore shutdowns and database errors.

**Solution**: Removed all manual timestamp fields from events. Let LiveStore handle timing automatically.

**Result**: Stable, reliable schemas that don't break under load.

### Session Management
**Problem**: No way to track or isolate kernel instances.

**Solution**: Each kernel gets unique `sessionId` with heartbeat tracking.

**Result**: Clean kernel lifecycle with isolation and recovery.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Schema changes not reflected | No build needed - changes to `shared/schema.ts` are immediately available |
| Type errors | TypeScript catches invalid queries at compile time - check column names |
| Execution not working | Start kernel with correct `NOTEBOOK_ID` |
| Slow execution | Should be instant - check kernel logs |
| Stale state | Run `pnpm reset-storage` |
