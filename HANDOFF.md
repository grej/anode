# LiveStore Kernel System - Updated Handoff

## Current State Summary

After extensive debugging and refactoring, we've resolved the major execution issues in the Anode kernel system. The system now has a simplified architecture with timestamps removed and proper event sequencing.

## Architecture Overview

- **Notebook System**: Each notebook = one LiveStore store (NOTEBOOK_ID = STORE_ID)
- **Kernel Process**: Python execution server using Pyodide, manually started per notebook
- **Execution Queue**: Event-driven system with states: `pending` → `assigned` → `executing` → `completed`
- **Communication**: Events synced via CloudFlare Workers sync backend

## ✅ MAJOR ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. Event Sequence Number Conflicts - FIXED
**Problem**: Kernel was committing events with incorrect sequence numbers, causing sync backend to reject them with "Invalid parent event number" errors.

**Solution**: Added initial sync delay before kernel commits its first event:
- 2-second configurable delay (`INITIAL_SYNC_DELAY` env var)
- Allows time for initial sync to complete before kernel registration
- Added debugging to show store state before committing events

### 2. Timestamp Schema Complexity - ELIMINATED
**Problem**: Complex Date ↔ number conversions in LiveStore schemas were causing parsing errors and LiveStore shutdowns.

**Root Cause**: 
```
ParseError: notebook
└─ ["createdAt"]
   └─ DateFromNumber
      └─ Type side transformation failure
         └─ Expected DateFromSelf, actual 1749852900062
```

**Solution**: **Completely removed all timestamp fields** from the system:
- **Tables**: Removed `createdAt`, `lastModified`, `startedAt`, `terminatedAt`, `heartbeatAt`, etc.
- **Events**: Removed timestamp parameters from all event schemas
- **Materializers**: Simplified to not handle date conversions
- **Web Client**: Updated to not send/reference timestamp fields
- **Kernel Client**: Updated to not send timestamp parameters

### 3. Circular Reactive Dependencies - PREVIOUSLY FIXED
**Solution**: Replaced reactive subscriptions with polling approach in kernel client.

### 4. Schema Materializer Errors - PREVIOUSLY FIXED  
**Solution**: Updated materializers to use safer query patterns with `.limit(1)` instead of `.first()`.

## Current System State

### ✅ **Working Components**
- **Event sequencing**: No more sync conflicts
- **Kernel registration**: Clean session startup and heartbeats
- **Polling architecture**: Stable assigned/pending work detection
- **Schema simplification**: All timestamp complexity eliminated
- **Basic execution flow**: Ready for end-to-end testing

### ⚠️ **Known Issues**
- **Tests need cleanup**: Schema tests still reference removed timestamp fields
- **TypeScript build artifacts**: May cause Zed/IDE issues (cleaned up build artifacts)
- **End-to-end flow**: Needs testing with actual cell execution

## Architecture Decisions Made

### ✅ **Timestamp Elimination Strategy**
- **Rationale**: Timestamps were causing more problems than value in this prototype
- **Benefits**: Simplified schema, eliminated conversion errors, reduced complexity
- **Trade-offs**: Lost audit trail capabilities (can be re-added later if needed)

### ✅ **Event Sequencing Strategy**  
- **Initial sync delay**: Simple but effective solution for startup timing
- **Configurable timing**: `INITIAL_SYNC_DELAY` env var for tuning
- **Store state debugging**: Added visibility into sync state

### ✅ **Polling Over Reactivity**
- **Assigned work**: 500ms polling for kernel's own work
- **Pending work**: 2s polling for claiming new work  
- **No reactive subscriptions**: Avoids circular dependency issues

## Current File State

### **Schema Package** (`packages/schema/`)
- ✅ **Simplified schemas**: All timestamp fields removed
- ✅ **Clean materializers**: No date conversion logic
- ⚠️ **Tests need fixing**: Still reference removed fields

### **Kernel Client** (`packages/dev-server-kernel-ls-client/`)
- ✅ **Initial sync delay**: Prevents sequence number conflicts
- ✅ **Polling architecture**: Stable work detection
- ✅ **Error handling**: Comprehensive debugging and stack traces
- ✅ **No timestamp events**: Updated for simplified schema

### **Web Client** (`packages/web-client/`)
- ✅ **No timestamp events**: Updated for simplified schema
- ✅ **UI simplified**: Removed timestamp displays
- ⚠️ **Some cleanup needed**: References to removed fields

## Testing Status

### **Current Test Setup**
```bash
# Start sync backend
pnpm dev:sync-only

# Start kernel for specific notebook  
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-$(date +%s)-test pnpm dev:kernel

# Start web client
pnpm dev:web-only
```

### **Test Notebook Creation Flow**
1. Navigate to web client
2. Initialize notebook (should work cleanly)
3. Create code cell (should work without LiveStore shutdown)
4. Execute cell (kernel should pick up and process)

## Key Configuration

### **Kernel Environment Variables**
```bash
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-123-abc           # Required: which notebook to serve
INITIAL_SYNC_DELAY=2000               # Optional: sync delay in ms
KERNEL_ID=kernel-${process.pid}       # Auto-generated
AUTH_TOKEN=insecure-token-change-me   # Sync backend auth
```

### **Current Architecture Benefits**
- **Simplified reasoning**: No timestamp conversion complexity
- **Stable event sequencing**: No more sync conflicts  
- **Predictable polling**: No reactive subscription issues
- **Clear separation**: Each notebook = isolated store
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Good visibility into system state

## Next Steps for Development

### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Fix remaining tests**: Remove timestamp references in schema tests
2. **End-to-end testing**: Verify full execution flow works
3. **Clean up TypeScript artifacts**: Ensure IDE stability

### **Short-term Improvements**
1. **Better sync detection**: Replace delay with actual sync state checking
2. **Error recovery**: Handle kernel restart scenarios gracefully
3. **Performance optimization**: Tune polling intervals

### **Long-term Architecture**
1. **Kernel lifecycle management**: Automatic start/stop per notebook
2. **Authentication**: Replace insecure tokens with proper auth
3. **Timestamp re-introduction**: Add back with proper LiveStore patterns if needed

## Development Commands

```bash
# Core development
pnpm build:schema                     # Required after schema changes
pnpm dev                             # Start web + sync
NOTEBOOK_ID=test pnpm dev:kernel     # Start kernel

# Debugging  
pnpm reset-storage                   # Clear all local storage
DEBUG=* NOTEBOOK_ID=test pnpm dev:kernel  # Verbose kernel logs

# Testing
pnpm type-check                      # Check all TypeScript
pnpm lint                           # Lint all packages
pnpm --filter @anode/schema test    # Run schema tests (needs fixing)
```

## Key Insights for Future Development

1. **LiveStore timestamp handling is complex** - simpler schemas are more reliable
2. **Event sequencing timing matters** - initial sync must complete first
3. **Polling is more predictable than reactive subscriptions** for complex workflows
4. **Comprehensive debugging is essential** for distributed event-driven systems
5. **Schema simplification > feature completeness** for prototypes

## Communication with Next Developer

The system is now in a much more stable state. The major architectural issues have been resolved, and the execution flow should work reliably. Focus on:

1. **Test cleanup first** - get the test suite passing
2. **End-to-end verification** - ensure cell execution actually works
3. **Incremental improvements** - add features back gradually

The timestamp removal was aggressive but necessary - it eliminated a whole class of type conversion issues that were causing system instability. This can be revisited later with proper LiveStore patterns once the core functionality is solid.
