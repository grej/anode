# Development Handoff

## Current Work State

**Status**: ✅ Core functionality operational, ready for AI integration phase

### What's Complete
- Zero-latency execution with reactive architecture
- Rich output rendering (HTML tables, SVG plots, markdown)
- Schema refactor - direct TypeScript imports working across all packages
- Mock AI responses integrated through standard execution queue

### What's Working Right Now
- Instant Python execution when kernel is running
- Real-time collaboration across multiple users
- Rich pandas DataFrame and matplotlib output
- All 60 tests passing

## Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Real AI Integration (2-3 hours)
**Current state**: Mock responses working perfectly through execution queue

**Next actions**:
- Replace `generateFakeAiResponse()` in `packages/dev-server-kernel-ls-client/src/mod-reactive.ts` (line 154+)
- Add OpenAI package to kernel dependencies
- Implement streaming responses for real-time output
- Handle API errors gracefully

**Files to modify**:
- `packages/dev-server-kernel-ls-client/src/mod-reactive.ts` - Main integration point
- `packages/web-client/src/components/notebook/AiCell.tsx` - Model selection UI
- Add API key configuration

### Priority 2: Auto Kernel Management (1-2 hours)  
**Current state**: Manual `NOTEBOOK_ID=xyz pnpm dev:kernel` works but is friction

**Next actions**:
- Modify `pnpm dev` to auto-spawn kernels per notebook
- Add kernel health monitoring
- Update UI to show kernel status automatically

**Files to modify**:
- Root `package.json` - Update dev script
- `packages/web-client/src/components/notebook/NotebookViewer.tsx` - Status display

### Priority 3: Basic Auth (1-2 hours)
**Current state**: No user management, everything works anonymously

**Next actions**:
- Add Google OAuth to web client
- Update schema to use real user IDs instead of "user-123"
- Associate notebooks with authenticated users

## Known Issues & Gotchas

### Schema Import Paths
- All packages now use relative imports like `../../../shared/schema.js`
- No build step needed - changes are immediate
- Must restart all services after schema changes to avoid version mismatches

### Execution Flow
- AI cells use the same execution queue as code cells (this is working well)
- Mock AI responses render as rich markdown - preserve this when adding real APIs
- Event deferral with `setTimeout(..., 0)` prevents LiveStore conflicts

### Testing
- Rich output regression tests are critical - don't break DataFrame/matplotlib rendering
- AI response formatting tests need to be updated when switching to real APIs

## Files I Was Working On

### Recently Modified
- `shared/schema.ts` - Main schema definition (moved from packages/schema/)
- `packages/dev-server-kernel-ls-client/src/mod-reactive.ts` - Kernel execution logic
- All package imports updated for new schema location

### Ready for Changes
- `packages/dev-server-kernel-ls-client/src/mod-reactive.ts` line 154+ - Replace mock AI
- `packages/web-client/src/components/notebook/AiCell.tsx` - UI improvements needed
- Root `package.json` scripts - Auto-kernel startup integration

## Development Commands

```bash
# Current workflow
pnpm dev                                 # Web + sync
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-123-abc pnpm dev:kernel  # Manual kernel start

# After auto-kernel work, should become just:
pnpm dev                                 # Everything auto-starts
```

## Quick Wins Available

1. **AI API integration** - Architecture proven, just need to swap mock for real API
2. **Auto-kernel startup** - Remove manual NOTEBOOK_ID step  
3. **Better error handling** - AI API failures need user-friendly messages

## What Not to Change

- Don't touch the rich output system - it's working well
- Don't modify the execution queue architecture - AI cells integrate perfectly
- Don't add timestamps to events - LiveStore handles automatically
- Keep the reactive subscriptions - they eliminated polling delays

## Next Developer Notes

The core technical challenges are solved. Focus on integrating real AI APIs while preserving the rich output quality we've achieved. The unified execution system makes AI cells first-class citizens - maintain that design.

Priority order: Real AI → Auto kernels → Auth → Advanced features
