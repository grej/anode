# AI Agent Development Context

This document provides essential context for AI assistants working on the Anode project.

## Project Overview

Anode is a real-time collaborative notebook system built on LiveStore, an event-sourcing based local-first data synchronization library. The project uses a monorepo structure with TypeScript and pnpm workspaces.

**Current Status**: Fully operational with zero-latency Python execution and rich output rendering.

## Architecture

- **Shared Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`): LiveStore schema definitions (events, state, materializers) - directly imported by all packages
- **Web Client** (`@anode/web-client`): React-based web interface
- **Document Worker** (`@anode/docworker`): Cloudflare Worker for sync backend
- **Kernel Client** (`@anode/dev-server-kernel-ls-client`): Python execution server (manual start per notebook)

## Key Dependencies

- **LiveStore**: Event-sourcing library for local-first apps
- **Effect**: Functional programming library for TypeScript
- **React**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Primary language

## Current Architecture - Fully Operational

### **Simplified Notebook/Store Relationship**
- `NOTEBOOK_ID = STORE_ID`: Each notebook gets its own LiveStore database
- URL routing: Access notebooks via `?notebook=notebook-id`
- Single notebook per store eliminates data boundary confusion
- All events naturally scoped to one notebook

### **Reactive Execution Queue System**
- Flow: `executionRequested` â†’ `executionAssigned` â†’ `executionStarted` â†’ `executionCompleted`
- **Kernels use reactive `queryDb` subscriptions** for instant work detection (no polling)
- **Zero-latency execution** - cells execute immediately when run
- Session-based assignment with auth enforcement planned
- **Fully operational** - working end-to-end with lightning-fast response

### **Rich Output System**
- **Multiple media types**: text/plain, text/markdown, text/html, image/svg+xml
- **Pandas DataFrames**: Professional HTML table styling with borders and formatting
- **Matplotlib plots**: SVG vector graphics with crisp rendering
- **AI responses**: Rich markdown with syntax highlighting and code blocks
- **Media type prioritization**: Best format automatically selected for display
- **Fallback support**: Always includes plain text as backup

### **Kernel Session Tracking**
- Each kernel restart gets unique `sessionId`
- 30-second heartbeat mechanism
- Session IDs tracked in execution queue
- Manual kernel management (start one per notebook)

## Development Setup

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start core services (web + sync)
pnpm dev

# Start kernel for specific notebook (manual)
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-123-abc pnpm dev:kernel

# Individual services
pnpm dev:web-only
pnpm dev:sync-only

# Development utilities
pnpm reset-storage  # Clear all local storage
pnpm build:schema   # Required after schema changes
```

- âœ… **Consistent behavior** across all cell types

## Important Considerations

### Schema Design
- Shared schema file (`shared/schema.ts`) provides direct imports with full type inference
- Single `notebook` table per store (not `notebooks`)
- `kernelSessions` and `executionQueue` tables for lifecycle management
- **No timestamp fields** - eliminated for simplicity and stability (LiveStore handles timing automatically)

### Local-First Architecture
- All data operations happen locally first
- Events synced across clients via document worker
- SQLite provides local reactive state per notebook
- Network connectivity optional

### Code Style
- Prefer functional programming patterns (Effect library)
- Event sourcing over direct state mutations
- Reactive queries over imperative data fetching
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

## File Structure
```
anode/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schema.ts         # LiveStore schema definitions (events, state, materializers)
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web-client/       # React web application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docworker/        # Cloudflare Worker sync backend
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dev-server-kernel-ls-client/  # Python kernel server
â”œâ”€â”€ start-dev.sh          # Development startup script
â”œâ”€â”€ reset-local-storage.cjs  # Clean development state
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Root workspace configuration
â””â”€â”€ pnpm-workspace.yaml   # Dependency catalog
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: No schema build needed - schema is directly imported from `shared/schema.ts`
- **Sync issues**: Check document worker deployment
- **Execution not working**: Start kernel manually with `NOTEBOOK_ID=your-notebook-id pnpm dev:kernel`
- **Stale state**: Run `pnpm reset-storage` to clear everything

### Debugging
- Browser console for client-side issues
- Wrangler logs for worker debugging
- Terminal output for kernel server issues
- Comprehensive logging in kernel for execution flow

## Important Note on Timestamps

**Do NOT use manual timestamps in code or events.** LiveStore automatically handles all timing through its event sourcing system. Focus development on features and architecture rather than timestamp management - this was a key lesson learned that improved system stability significantly.
