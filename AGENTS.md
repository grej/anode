# AI Agent Development Context

This document provides essential context for AI assistants working on the Anode project.

## Project Overview

Anode is a real-time collaborative notebook system built on LiveStore, an event-sourcing based local-first data synchronization library. The project uses a monorepo structure with TypeScript and pnpm workspaces.

**Current Status**: Fully operational with zero-latency Python execution.

## Architecture

- **Schema Package** (`@anode/schema`): LiveStore schema definitions (events, state, materializers)
- **Web Client** (`@anode/web-client`): React-based web interface
- **Document Worker** (`@anode/docworker`): Cloudflare Worker for sync backend
- **Kernel Client** (`@anode/dev-server-kernel-ls-client`): Python execution server (manual start per notebook)

## Key Dependencies

- **LiveStore**: Event-sourcing library for local-first apps
- **Effect**: Functional programming library for TypeScript
- **React**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Primary language

## Current Architecture - Fully Operational

### **Simplified Notebook/Store Relationship**
- `NOTEBOOK_ID = STORE_ID`: Each notebook gets its own LiveStore database
- URL routing: Access notebooks via `?notebook=notebook-id`
- Single notebook per store eliminates data boundary confusion
- All events naturally scoped to one notebook

### **Reactive Execution Queue System**
- Flow: `executionRequested` â†’ `executionAssigned` â†’ `executionStarted` â†’ `executionCompleted`
- **Kernels use reactive `queryDb` subscriptions** for instant work detection (no polling)
- **Zero-latency execution** - cells execute immediately when run
- Session-based assignment with auth enforcement planned
- **Fully operational** - working end-to-end with lightning-fast response

### **Kernel Session Tracking**
- Each kernel restart gets unique `sessionId`
- 30-second heartbeat mechanism
- Session IDs tracked in execution queue
- Manual kernel management (start one per notebook)

## Development Setup

### Common Commands
```bash
# Start core services (web + sync)
pnpm dev

# Start kernel for specific notebook (manual)
NOTEBOOK_ID=notebook-123-abc pnpm dev:kernel

# Individual services
pnpm dev:web-only
pnpm dev:sync-only

# Development utilities
pnpm reset-storage  # Clear all local storage
pnpm build:schema   # Required after schema changes
```

## Current Working State

## Next Phase: AI Integration & Advanced Features ðŸ¤–

**Priority Focus**: AI â†” Python â†” User interactions with enterprise-grade features

### Immediate Goals
- **Real AI API Integration** - Replace mock responses with OpenAI, Anthropic, local model calls
- **Markdown Rendering** - Render AI responses as formatted markdown instead of plain text
- **Automatic Kernel Management** - One-click notebook startup with auto-kernel lifecycle
- **Code Completions** - LSP + kernel-based suggestions with Pyodide integration
- **Authentication System** - Google OAuth with proper session management
- **SQL Cell Implementation** - Real database connections and query execution

### Medium-term Roadmap
- **Enhanced Output Rendering** - Rich media, plots, and interactive visualizations
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Live cursors and presence indicators
- **Advanced Cell Operations** - Multi-select, drag-and-drop reordering
- **Performance Optimization** - Handle large notebooks efficiently

### Recent UX Achievements âœ…
- âœ… Fluid notebook navigation with arrow keys
- âœ… Always-on textareas replacing click-to-edit model
- âœ… Clean, focus-driven interface design
- âœ… Standard keyboard shortcuts (Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter)
- âœ… Prominent keyboard shortcuts help
- âœ… Consistent behavior across all cell types

## Important Considerations

### Schema Design
- Schema package must be built before dependent packages can consume changes
- Single `notebook` table per store (not `notebooks`)
- `kernelSessions` and `executionQueue` tables for lifecycle management
- **No timestamp fields** - eliminated for simplicity and stability (LiveStore handles timing automatically)

### Local-First Architecture
- All data operations happen locally first
- Events synced across clients via document worker
- SQLite provides local reactive state per notebook
- Network connectivity optional

### Code Style
- Prefer functional programming patterns (Effect library)
- Event sourcing over direct state mutations
- Reactive queries over imperative data fetching
- TypeScript strict mode enabled

## File Structure
```
anode/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ schema/           # LiveStore schema definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web-client/       # React web application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docworker/        # Cloudflare Worker sync backend
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dev-server-kernel-ls-client/  # Python kernel server
â”œâ”€â”€ start-dev.sh          # Development startup script
â”œâ”€â”€ reset-local-storage.cjs  # Clean development state
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Root workspace configuration
â””â”€â”€ pnpm-workspace.yaml   # Dependency catalog
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build failures**: Run `pnpm build:schema` first
- **Sync issues**: Check document worker deployment
- **Execution not working**: Start kernel manually with `NOTEBOOK_ID=your-notebook-id pnpm dev:kernel`
- **Stale state**: Run `pnpm reset-storage` to clear everything

### Debugging
- Browser console for client-side issues
- Wrangler logs for worker debugging
- Terminal output for kernel server issues
- Comprehensive logging in kernel for execution flow

## Notes for AI Assistants

- Focus on AI â†” Python â†” User interaction goals as primary differentiator
- Acknowledge both technical and UX achievements completed
- Emphasize production readiness and solid foundation for AI features
- Balance current capabilities with enterprise collaboration roadmap

### Key Insights for Development

**Current Development Cycle**: Major UX improvements completed in June 2025, creating a fluid notebook experience that rivals Jupyter while maintaining real-time collaboration advantages.

The system provides a **production-ready foundation** for AI-native collaborative notebooks with modern UX and is positioned for advanced enterprise features.

## Important Note on Timestamps

**Do NOT use manual timestamps in code or events.** LiveStore automatically handles all timing through its event sourcing system. Focus development on features and architecture rather than timestamp management - this was a key lesson learned that improved system stability significantly.
